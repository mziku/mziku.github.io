In this years conference [“Taboo, Transgression, Transcendence in Art & Science”](https://avarts.ionio.gr/ttt/) (26-28 May 2017, Ionian University, Corfu Greece) I presented an essay in an html format on the intersection of art theory and artificial intelligence in Greece through a case study and a theoretical approach.

The paper included in the conference proceedings is a follow up of my theoretical research in the cross-disciplinary field of art theory and artificial intelligence.

**Title**  
Art Theory and Artificial Intelligence in Greece: Documenting 30 years of a cross-disciplinary research

**Abstract**  
The essay aims to bring forward the ongoing collaboration of artist-writer Poly Kasda and professor of artificial intelligence John Kontos, who marked the beginning of the art theory, consciousness and artificial intelligence discourse in Greece in the mid 80’s, based on an original research.

To this end, the essay outlines three projects of Kasda‒Kontos collaboration in the course of 30 years, which marked their cross-disciplinary research:

- The film documentary ‘The Adventures of the Eye’ (1986)
- Kasda’s book publication ‘The Conscious Eye: Art – Perception – Informatics’ (1988)
- Kasda–Kontos’ joint book publication ‘Artificial Intelligence Professor John Kontos needles Poly Kasda’s “Conscious Eye”: Perception – Consciousness – Diegesis – Discovery – Creativity’ (2015).
