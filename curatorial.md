**Fund**	Goethe-Institut Thessaloniki

*The exhibition concept is based on Vladimir Propp's book 'Morphology of the folktale', where Propp introduces patterns that come along a story formation. GIFs reflect the anonymous, collective narratives from a contemporary visual perspective. The exhibition explores the transformativity and underlying patterns of the GIF-medium in semantic ways, where a micro-fiction is expressed in manifold ways, relating to an initial pattern or element. The exhibition focuses on visual, textual and software patterns that propagate through multiple derivative GIFs, forming a digital folklore of collective web-user engagement.*
