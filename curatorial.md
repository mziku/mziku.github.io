Assistant Curator: Katerina Zachou

[**GIF: Morphologies of a copyleft tale**](https://www.cact.gr/en/news/movingsilence) (Graphic arts and digital exhibition – Curator)  
*__Venue__: Thessaloniki Center of Contemporary Art, Thessaloniki, Greece, 2017*  
*__Partners__: Moving Silence Network, HMKW University of Applied Sciences (Germany), Librarybox*  
*__Fund__: Goethe-Institut Thessaloniki*   
The exhibition concept is based on Vladimir Propp's book 'Morphology of the folktale' where Propp introduces patterns that come along a story formation. GIFs reflect the anonymous, collective narratives from a contemporary visual perspective. The exhibition explores the transformativity and underlying patterns of the GIF-medium in semantic ways, where a micro-fiction is expressed in manifold ways, relating to an initial pattern or element. The exhibition focuses on visual, textual and software patterns that propagate through multiple derivative GIFs.  
Coordination: Eirini Papakonstantinou, Art director: Matthias Fritsch

The exhibition explored the self-enclosed aesthetic micro-worlds of GIFs, highlighting their unique visual techniques. It was realized as a media exhibition in the space of ARTos Foundation, framed by an urban tour with pop-up gif projections, whole night GIF projection ‘stations‘ within the city and an analogue GIF workshop.
