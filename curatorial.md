[**GIF: Morphologies of a copyleft tale**](https://www.cact.gr/en/news/movingsilence) (Graphic arts and digital exhibition – Curator)  
*__Venue__: Thessaloniki Center of Contemporary Art, Thessaloniki, Greece, 2017*  
*__Partners__: Moving Silence Network, HMKW University of Applied Sciences (Germany), Librarybox*  
*__Fund__: Goethe-Institut Thessaloniki*   
The exhibition concept is based on Vladimir Propp's book 'Morphology of the folktale', where Propp introduces patterns that come along a story formation. GIFs reflect the anonymous, collective narratives from a contemporary visual perspective. The exhibition explores the transformativity and underlying patterns of the GIF-medium in semantic ways, where a micro-fiction is expressed in manifold ways, relating to an initial pattern or element. The exhibition focuses on visual, textual and software patterns that propagate through multiple derivative GIFs, forming a digital folklore of collective web-user engagement.  
Coordination: Eirini Papakonstantinou, Art director: Matthias Fritsch

It was realized as a media exhibition in the space of ARTos Foundation, framed by an urban tour with pop-up GIF projections, whole night GIF projection ‘stations‘ within the city and an analogue GIF workshop.

In the context of the Festival for Silent Film Culture, the GIF art exhibition expanded the silent film format in the networked digital space. The project was realised as an 'immaterial' exhibition in html format, hosted within the open-source local networking toolkit 'Piratebox' and traveling along the venues. The audience could access the exhibition only on-site through their mobile devices.

How do these countries’ respective historical identities and individual stories of their own history, shape the ideas of a possible tomorrow?
