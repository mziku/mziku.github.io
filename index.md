Mariana Ziku is a researcher, art theorist and curator. She is co-founder and programme curator of the [Biennale of Western Balkans](https://bowb.org), arts & cultural organisation promoting intangible cultural heritage through contemporary art, new technologies and digital scholarship.  

Her practice focuses on the digital perspectives of intangible heritage, the concept of immateriality in art and community-based expressions in art and culture. Her curatorial work examines the contemporary interpretations of intangible heritage as digital folklore, born-digital communities of practice, creative expressions of the collective imaginary and collaborative copying cultural practices. 

She is currently part of the [European ARTificial Intelligence Lab](https://ars.electronica.art/ailab/en) as project associate. She has been working in the framework of European Cultural Programmes and Cross-Border Cooperation Programmes in the Balkans as museum curator and project editor (Interreg IPA CBC, Creative Europe). Her curatorial research projects have been funded, among others, by the Ministry of Culture in Greece, Goethe-Institut and the European Creative Europe Programme.  

She holds a MSc in Digital Humanities (Department of Computer Science, KU Leuven, Belgium), a MA in Art Theory/History and Curation, a BA in Art Sciences (Department of Fine Arts and Art Sciences, University of Ioannina, Greece) and a CERT in Cultural Management (Centre of Continuous Education and Training, University of Athens). She is also graduate of classical piano and classical music harmony of the Municipal Conservatory of Ioannina.
