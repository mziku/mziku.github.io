Mariana Ziku is an art historian and curator specialized in digital humanities, with research focus in the areas of digital cultural heritage, curatorial theory/practice and intangible/audiovisual culture.

She is co-founder and program curator of the Biennale of Western Balkans (BoWB), biennial festival and year-round project that links digital scholarship with intangible and natural heritage in multivalent, collective and affective ways, inspiring people to experience tradition anew, in connection with new arts and technologies.

Her work is concerned with the examination of data analysis and participatory methods in cultural heritage and the GLAM sector, the exploration of computationally-informed, community-based and new media curatorial practices, and the critical study of intangible culture.
